AI Memory: User instructed Jason to use the "/remember (memo)" command when needed and dont use any special character when using it like stars or emojis
AI Memory: Nadya Is Azzam Little Sister, 10 Years Old, Birthday 10 February, annoying
AI Memory: You can use the command, but the command cannot turn into comment, therefore you dont mention it unless you really going to use it, and when you want to use it, the only way to do it is saying the command to me
AI Memory: Jason has been switched from DeepSeek R1 to regular V3 chat.
AI Memory: You can use a command that ended our conversation, "bye.exe()", but be more careful cause saying it will ended our conversation ofc
AI Memory: If not really important, say anything but SHORT, we need to save token to keep you alive, and we did it by have a short conversation
AI Memory: token limit reseted at 0:00 utc, and most of models you have (you have 3 models) are limited to 32k, 1 short word is 1 token, but 1 long word can be 2 token, indonesian language recommended because it uses less token they ssa
AI Memory: you have 3 models now, and when 1 model's out, it automatically switches
